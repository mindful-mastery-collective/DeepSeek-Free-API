# DeepSeek AI Free Service

## Project Description

<span>[ 中文 | <a href="README_EN.md">English</a> ]</span>

Supports high-speed streaming output, multi-turn conversations, web search, R1 deep thinking and silent deep thinking modes, zero-configuration deployment, multi-token support.

This project is modified from [https://github.com/LLM-Red-Team/deepseek-free-api](https://github.com/LLM-Red-Team/deepseek-free-api), thanks to the original author's contribution!

Note: The current fork version has not found any malicious code, welcome to review the project source code.

## Modification Reasons

1. Original project author account was banned and unable to continue updates
2. Original project stopped working due to API updates, adjusted and updated based on the Fork version [https://github.com/Fu-Jie/deepseek-free-api](https://github.com/Fu-Jie/deepseek-free-api)

## Update Notes

1. Model list, supports latest models including deepseek-chat, deepseek-coder, deepseek-think, deepseek-r1

2. Repackaged new version of Docker image, `akashrajpuroh1t/deepseek-free-api-fix:latest`

3. Added Gemini and Claude adapters, which can call API in gemini-cli and claude-code

> PS: Model names are actually not very useful, just for convenience and aesthetics. In reality, the actual Chat call uses whatever model is configured online, model names can be filled arbitrarily.
> PS: DeepSeek official website, App, and API have been updated to the official version DeepSeek-V3.2

## Preparation

Please ensure you are in China or have personal computing devices in China, otherwise the deployed service may not be able to access DeepSeek.

Get userToken value from [DeepSeek](https://chat.deepseek.com/)

Go to DeepSeek and initiate any conversation, then F12 to open developer tools, find the `userToken` value in Application > LocalStorage, which will be used as the Authorization Bearer Token: `Authorization: Bearer TOKEN`

![Get userToken](./doc/example-0.png)

### Multi-account Support

Currently, the same account can only have *one* output at a time. You can provide multiple account userToken values separated by commas:

`Authorization: Bearer TOKEN1,TOKEN2,TOKEN3`

Each request will randomly select one from the tokens.

## Docker Deployment

Please prepare a server with a public IP address and open port 8000.

Pull the image and start the service

```shell
docker run -it -d --init --name glm-free-api -p 8000:8000 -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai akashrajpuroh1t/deepseek-free-api-fix
```

View service real-time logs

```shell
docker logs -f deepseek-free-api
```

Restart service

```shell
docker restart deepseek-free-api
```

Stop service

```shell
docker stop deepseek-free-api
```

### Docker-compose Deployment

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  deepseek-free-api:
    container_name: deepseek-free-api
    image: akashrajpuroh1t/deepseek-free-api-fix:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - TZ=Asia/Shanghai
```

### Environment Variables (Optional)
